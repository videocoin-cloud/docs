# **Developer Documentation: VideoCoin-Cloud Platform**

---

## **Introduction**
The VideoCoin-Cloud Platform is a robust, scalable, and modular solution for media processing and management. It is designed to handle video streaming, transcoding, user management, billing, and other cloud-based services. Built on Kubernetes, the platform uses Terraform for infrastructure management and Helm for deploying microservices. This documentation provides developers with insights into the platformâ€™s architecture, modules, and workflows to facilitate integration and development.

---

## **Platform Architecture**

### **1. Overview**
The platform follows a microservices-based architecture, where each service performs a specific function. These services interact seamlessly to enable media ingestion, processing, and delivery. Core components include services for user management, video transcoding, billing, and more.

### **2. Key Components**

#### **a. Kubernetes**
- **Namespace**: All services and resources are isolated within a namespace (`console-videocoin-network`) to maintain logical separation.
- **Secrets**: Kubernetes secrets are used to manage sensitive data like Docker registry credentials.

#### **b. Google Secret Manager**
- **Purpose**: Securely stores sensitive credentials used by the platform (e.g., Docker registry credentials, Helm repository authentication).
- **Integration**: Secrets are dynamically injected into the Kubernetes environment during deployment.

#### **c. Helm**
- **Service Deployment**: Each microservice is deployed using Helm charts for modularity and version control.
- **Repository**: -To be published -

2. **cloud-streams**: Enables video streaming, ensuring seamless playback for end users.
3. **cloud-ingester**: Handles the ingestion of media files or data streams into the platform.
4. **cloud-miners**: Processes compute-intensive workloads, including video transcoding and encoding.
5. **cloud-splitter**: Processes or splits media into segments for further processing or delivery.

---

### **2. User and Account Management**
6. **cloud-users**: Handles user account creation, management, and authentication.
7. **cloud-accounts**: Manages account-related operations and data.
8. **cloud-profiles**: Manages user profile information and metadata.
9. **cloud-iam**: Provides identity and access management for users and services.

---

### **3. Billing and Notifications**
10. **cloud-billing**: Manages billing, payment processing, and related financial operations.
11. **cloud-notifications**: Sends notifications to users via email, SMS, or in-app messages.

---

### **4. Event and Job Management**
12. **cloud-dispatcher**: Distributes and schedules processing jobs across the platform.
13. **cloud-emitter**: Handles event publishing and broadcasting for inter-service communication.
14. **cloud-hookd**: Manages ingest hooks, triggering workflows or processing pipelines.
15. **cloud-mlistener**: Listens for machine learning-related tasks or events.

---

### **5. Gateway and API**
16. **cloud-gateway**: Serves as the API gateway for routing external requests to appropriate microservices.
17. **cloud-api**: Exposes API endpoints for external integrations.
18. **cloud-swagger**: Provides API documentation using Swagger.

---

### **6. UI and Administrative Tools**
19. **cloud-ui**: The user interface for managing the platform and interacting with its features.
20. **cloud-admin**: A work-in-progress (WIP) admin panel for interacting with databases and managing services.

---

### **7. Scaling and Testing**
21. **cloud-autoscaler**: Automatically adjusts resources and scales services based on workload demands.
22. **cloud-test-framework**: Provides a framework for testing the platform's components.
23. **cloud-testsuite**: A suite of tests to validate the functionality and reliability of the platform.

---

### **8. Supporting Libraries and Tools**
24. **cloud-pkg**: Contains reusable packages and libraries for internal use.
25. **cloud-servicemanager**: Manages the lifecycle and orchestration of services.
26. **cloud-sync**: Synchronizes data and state across different platform services.
27. **cloud-uploader**: Facilitates the uploading of media files or other content.

## **Developer Workflow**

### **1. Media Processing Workflow**
1. Media files are ingested into the platform using the `cloud-ingester` service.
2. The `cloud-dispatcher` schedules processing jobs.
3. Videos are transcoded by `cloud-miners` and stored in `cloud-media-server`.
4. The `cloud-streams` service delivers processed media to end users.

### **2. User Interaction Workflow**
1. Users can manage accounts and profiles through the `cloud-ui`.
2. Notifications are sent for updates on job completion or billing.

### **3. Administration Workflow**
1. Admins can manage resources and monitor activity through the `cloud-admin` panel.
2. Service scaling is handled automatically or via configuration in the `cloud-autoscaler`.

## **System Requirements**

### **1. Kubernetes**
- Kubernetes cluster (v1.20 or later) with sufficient resources for microservices.

### **2. Dependencies**
- Terraform for infrastructure management.
- Helm for deploying and managing services.

### **3. Supported Tools**
- Google Secret Manager for managing sensitive credentials.

## **FAQ**

### **Q1: What happens if a service fails?**
- Kubernetes automatically restarts failed services to maintain availability.

### **Q2: How do I integrate external tools with the platform?**
- Use the `cloud-api` or `cloud-gateway` services to interact with the platform via APIs.

### **Q3: Is the platform secure?**
- Yes, credentials are securely managed using Google Secret Manager, and all sensitive data is encrypted.
